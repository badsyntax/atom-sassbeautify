This package is currently under development, and has only been tested on OSX.

You will need to install Sass.

If are you using a ruby version manager, you will need to set the PATH in the package settings: Preferences >> Sassbeautify >> Path. (To get the PATH, open up a new shell and type `echo $PATH`.)

Please create an issue if it does not work for you.
